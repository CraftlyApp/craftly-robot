# Craftly Robot

Craftly Robot is a lightweight command-line tool for managing codebases at scale. Need to set up project structure, or edit and modify files in a large codebase? Just describe it in a JSON file, and let Craftly Robot handle it for you.

---

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/craftlyapp/craftly-robot.git
    cd craftly-robot
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have Python 3.6+**

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Prepare an instruction JSON**

    Craftly Robot operates based on a list of atomic instructions described in a JSON file. A sample is in the `instructions/` folder.

2.  **Run Craftly Robot**

    This command executes the instructions.

    ```bash
    python3 craftly_robot.py -i instructions/sample.json
    ```

    **Output on Success:**
    ```bash
    ‚úì [1/3] created folder: my_project
    ‚úì [2/3] created file: my_project/hello.txt
    ‚úì [3/3] added line: 1 Hello, Craftly Robot!
    ! To revert back, run: python3 craftly_robot.py -i instructions/sample.json --undo
    ```

3.  **Handling Failures**

    If an instruction fails, the robot stops and shows you exactly where the error occurred. It still creates a backup of the steps that succeeded, so you can easily revert back.

    **Output on Failure:**
    ```bash
    ‚úì [1/3] created folder: my_project
    ‚úó [2/3] Missing parent folder: non_existent_dir
    ! To revert back, run: python3 craftly_robot.py -i instructions/sample.json --undo
    ```

| `path`      | `string` | The filesystem path for the operation.       |

**For line operations**, include these additional keys:

| Key       | Type     | Description                                           |
