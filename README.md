# Craftly Robot

Craftly Robot is a lightweight command-line tool for managing codebases at scale. Need to set up project structure, or edit and modify files in a large codebase? Just describe it in a JSON file, and let Craftly Robot handle it for you.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/craftlyapp/craftly-robot.git
    cd craftly-robot
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have Python 3.6+**

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Prepare an instruction JSON**

    Craftly Robot operates based on a list of atomic instructions described in a JSON file. A sample is in the `instructions` folder.

2.  **Run Craftly Robot**

    This command executes the instructions.

    ```bash
    python3 craftly_robot.py -i instructions/sample.json
    ```

    **Output on Success:**
    ```bash
    ‚úì [1/3] created folder: my_project
    ‚úì [2/3] created file: my_project/hello.txt
    ‚úì [3/3] added line: 1 Hello, Craftly Robot!
    ! To revert back, run: python3 craftly_robot.py -i instructions/sample.json --undo
    ```

3.  **Handling Failures**

    If an instruction fails, the robot stops and shows you exactly where the error occurred. It still creates a backup of the steps that succeeded, so you can easily revert back.

    **Output on Failure:**
    ```bash
    ‚úì [1/3] created folder: my_project
    ‚úó [2/3] Missing parent folder: non_existent_dir
    ! To revert back, run: python3 craftly_robot.py -i instructions/sample.json --undo
    ```

| Argument  | Alias | Required | Description                                |
| :-------- | :---- | :------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `--input` | `-i`  | Yes      | Path to the JSON instruction file.         |
| `--undo`  |       | No       | Reverts the changes using the backup file. |

## üîß Instruction Schema

Each instruction is a single JSON object with the following keys:

| Key         | Type                          | Description                                                                                             |
| :---------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `operation` | `string`                      | The action to perform: `create` or `delete`.                                                            |
| `mode`      | `string`                      | The target type: `folder`, `file`, or `line`.                                                           |
| `path`      | `array of strings`            | A list of one or more target paths for the operation.                                                   |
| `content`   | `dictionary` or `array` | Data for `line` operations (dictionary to create, array to delete). **Required only when `mode` is "line".** |

## ‚úÖ Operation Examples

### Folder Operations
*   The value for `path` is always a list.
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "create",
      "mode": "folder",
      "path": ["./src", "./tests"]
    }
    ```

### File Operations
*   The value for `path` is always a list.
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "create",
      "mode": "file",
      "path": ["main.py", "README.md"]
    }
    ```

### Line Operations
*   **Create Lines**: The `content` value is a **dictionary** of `{"line_number": "content_string"}`. These edits are applied to all files in the `path` list.
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "create",
      "mode": "line",
      "path": ["main.py", "utils.py"],
      "content": {
        "1": "#!/usr/bin/python3"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Delete Lines**: The `content` value is an **array** of line numbers. These lines are removed from all files in the `path` list.
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "delete",
      "mode": "line",
      "path": ["main.py"],
      "content": [2, 7, 10]
    }
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

*   Throws descriptive errors on:
    *   Missing parent directories
    *   Existing targets on `create`
    *   Non-empty folders on `delete_folder`
    *   Invalid line numbers
    *   JSON syntax issues
